# Smart-Boiler-System
RISC course final project. (Code language: C)


The project is based on Nuvoton's NUC140VE3CN microprocessor and is controlled by mobile phone, the smart boiler system includes timer, Sabbath mode and temperature control (my original idea, which turns off the boiler when it reaches the temperature set by the user) apps. The system displays the current water temperature and a RGB LED which changes colors according to its degrees. In addition, the system has Children safety control that prevents the boiler from reaching a dangerous temperature for children, when the boiler exceeds 65C degrees it turns off and activates a sound alert until the boiler drops below 65C degrees.
In this project I put emphasis on user interface, detailed and visible instructions that includes displaying special icons and even a designed opening video.
### Skills I acquired during the project:
In this project I studied the memory limitation issues of microprocessors which required me to optimize the code several times. In addition, I learned how complicated but important it is to create a good user interface.<br><br>
